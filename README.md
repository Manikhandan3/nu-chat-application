## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/whatsapp-clone.git
cd whatsapp-clone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

You'll need to configure environment variables for Clerk, Convex, OpenAI, and ZegoCloud.

#### A. Create .env.local file

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following keys:

```env
# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# ZegoCloud
ZEGO_APP_ID=
ZEGO_SERVER_SECRET=
```

#### B. Set up Convex & Get Keys

Run the Convex development server. It will prompt you to log in and create a new project.

```bash
npx convex dev
```

Follow the CLI instructions. It will populate `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in your `.env.local` file.

Go to your project's Convex Dashboard. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables** and add the following:

| Variable Name | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| `CLERK_ISSUER_URL` | Your Clerk Issuer URL (e.g., `https://*.clerk.accounts.dev`) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Your OpenAI API key |
| `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Your Clerk webhook signing secret |

#### C. Set up Clerk

1. Create a Clerk account and a new project
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** into your `.env.local` file
3. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **JWT Templates** and create a new template based on "Convex". Copy the **Issuer URL** and add it to your Convex environment variables as `CLERK_ISSUER_URL`
4. In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **Webhooks**, create a new endpoint, and set the URL to `YOUR_CONVEX_URL/clerk` (e.g., `https://happy-animal-123.convex.site/clerk`)
5. Select the `user.created`, `user.updated`, `session.created`, and `session.ended` events
6. Copy the **Signing Secret** and add it to your Convex environment variables as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### D. Set up OpenAI & ZegoCloud

1. Get your API key from OpenAI and add it to your Convex environment variables
2. Create a project on ZegoCloud, get your **App ID** and **Server Secret**, and add them to your `.env.local` file

### 4. Run the Application

With `npx convex dev` still running in one terminal, open another terminal and start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
